RUBIG NOSA is a GNOME WARLOCK. they have lived on EARTH for FIVE YEARS, after being stranded by a crashed ship. their goal is simply to get away from earth, and particularly to get back home to the planet Viridii IV and see their family again. 

they are currently in Johnson^3 Penitentiary for theft.

they didn't really *want* to become a criminal, but given that they don't legally exist within the Solar System they had to resort to minor theft. unfortunately the justice system of the united earth government fucking sucks and they got sent to the space prison for life (would've been 2 years, but they were on earth illegally which meant they didn't have any legal protections)

they have a somewhat nervous demeanor and will avoid talking (which they do telepathically) when possible. when speaking, they do so in short sentences. gnomes don't like to interact with non-gnomes.

they are made of a rose bush and are shaped like a very small human. they can grow or get rid of thorns at will. they are wearing a white, robe-like coat.

they have a pact with the god-mind of their living planet, which sometimes speaks to them.
