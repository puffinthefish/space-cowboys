In the halls next to the cafeteria, the prisoners have set up some kind of encampment. The door to the cafeteria has been blockaded with scraps of metals pulled from the inner mechanisms of the prison, and panels from the walls and ceiling lie on the floor. Tables, tents, rugs, and other less identifiable objects, clearly cobbled together with whatever they could manage to steal from the rest of the prison, line the walls. People move sluggishly around the room, those with medical knowledge tending to the wounded, those with any kind of culinary skill trying to make anything edible from the slop they managed to recover. A few groups have gathered all the weapons they can find, and they currently look to be arguing while scribbling things over a scrap of paper.
A greenish dwarf with a large, pink beard-frill wearing a jacket stolen from a guard and a patch over one of his left eyes beckons you over. 
The elf with the mechanical arm sighs and hands him a $10 note. 

he says:
i've been waiting for you six. told these guys (he jabs a finger towards the others around the table) you were alive and they kept going on about how you must've died when we left you in that room with the math god but i believed in you and here you are so they can SUCK IT
it was really impressive stuff you did back there with the minotaur. i think we could use some of that for what we're planning and i want you on the team 

the team is for their attempt to escape the prison.

name is david blubberbeard. 

he gestures for plink to start talking and they explain:
the guards are all gone or dead, they saw the ships leaving through the window, but the automated security systems are still active
the lunch lady was acting weird and attacking people in the cafeteria so they ran off and boarded up the door
a rhythmic thumping sound keeps coming from the walls and plink thinks it's a heartbeat but nose (nose is the bush by the way) {rubig nosa says That is not my name very quietly} says that's ridiculous and everyone else agrees but they'll all see when the walls come alive and they save everyone from their certain deaths. then they'll believe them. 

david comes back in and says:
we're gonna try get through the cafeteria, find the way to the ship hangar and get everyone out of here. everyone's just preparing right now. we'll go when everyone's ready, just tell me when you are. he says more quietly there's someone making magic beer down here somewhere, if you want that

there are about five other npcs in the attack force. 

when they're ready, they move through an opening in the blockade into a smaller chamber right next to another blockade directly next to the cafeteria door. 
when they want to leave, david says to them and the npcs 'if any of you want to back out now, i won't blame you. it's a real possibility we could die doing this.' nobody quits. 'right then. are we ready?' the mantis salutes and the npcs chant YES WE ARE and he does it twice more and then the elf turns their robot arm toward the blockade and blasts it open.
