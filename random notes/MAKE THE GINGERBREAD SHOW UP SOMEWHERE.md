from morrigans backstory:
When she was 13, she first discovered the power of magic. She soon began experimenting with all sorts of herbs, potions, and baking, mixing the first two into the last. With no teacher, however, her powers soon spiralled out of control. By mixing in wolfsbane with blossock pollen and the gingerbread, the ginger bread grew more intelligent and sinister. They managed to break out of the oven, setting the house aflame. The fire quickly spread to nearby housing. By the time help arrived, half the village had burned down. They found Morrigan in the center of the flames, crouched down on the ground, and perfectly calm.

gingerbread hive mind taken over the vatican?
