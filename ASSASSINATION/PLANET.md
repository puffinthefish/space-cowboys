earthlike world. named ZLEEBUS PRIME
similar life to earth, but plants are purple instead of green and most animals have an eight legged body plan 

many large cities. extremely urbanised
colony world that begun a few thousand years ago, unified world government. originally inhabited by elves before they joined the union, now inhabited by most sapient species but primarily elves.

cities are built with extremely tall spires held up by antigrav tech once they start reaching stupid heights
very blue and purple and green, almost organic looking

buildings are constructed from specialised organisms and metals grown in pillars and shit

MAIN THING is that all the buildings are sorta blue and plant looking and VERY CIRCULAR
