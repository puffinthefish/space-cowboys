artificial planet of unknown origin. its surface has anomalous properties, and whenever a probe is sent, its signal duplicates and fragments. they are not told to plant a bomb this time, but instead reach and detonate the planet's core. they are given a vehicle with tunneling capabilities and a gun that shoots blasts that they are told will destroy the core. ![[[WARDEN ONLY] - GADER'EL ALPHA C-4.png]]
the planet is covered in doors. the doors have no consistent properties, just that they are doors. they seem to come from all different planets and cultures and time periods, and are only similar in that they possess a doorway and something to close them. 

every door is linked to another, random, door. momentum is preserved through the doors. the surface of the planet is completely flat, with the ground made of closed doors (that can be opened), save for enormous walls that protrude from the landscape every ten-ish kilometres.

it is populated exclusively by constructs. the constructs will cooperate with the players as long as they don't know of their intentions. they are extremely gullible and cannot easily tell whether the players are lying. 

the walls all contain paths to the central chambers of the planet and were built by the planet's creators to access it. the constructs will lead them there, and if asked any questions, will tell them to ask their supervisor as that is above their level. their supervisor is a clearly decomposing corpse sitting in an office chair. 

the central chambers are basically a dungeon. all the signage is written in a language the players cannot understand, and all the constructs within it will attack as the players do not have the energy signatures of the creators. the walls are gilded gold and bronze and piping and such is visible in the corners of the rooms. 

every room contains a single door. the door has an interface allowing for the room to be chosen, but the players don't have the key to open it. if the door shorts out, it will open to a random room every time. 

any area that constructs are not allowed to access is rusted and broken.
