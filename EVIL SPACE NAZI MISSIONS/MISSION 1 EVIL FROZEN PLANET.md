scientist fridge man tells them theyve been put on . special operations or something 

they get sent to ![[[WARDEN ONLY] - BALDR NP-6550.png]] this place
its freezing, so they have to use like space suit type stuff to not freeze to death. they CAN be broken but not easily

their mission is to place a VERY OBVIOUSLY A BOMB device on a specific mountain. the mountain has 
there is a person on mission control. their name is bingus and they are from super texas. they are in the process of divorce right now. it isnt great.

they 

the planet is covered with a permanent blizzard, and from space looks like a ball of pure white and blue
on the ground they have very low visibility, but what they can see is

they land in a desert. the ground is rock and gravel, covered with snow. there are completely frozen lakes all across the planet. there are spikes of rock that jut through the ice, and frozen animals can be seen in the lakes. 
there are mountains in the distance. they need to head towards them.
the sky is permanently dark blue / purple cuz of the permanent eclipse

as they approach the mountain they see a warm light. it is the chuul settlement. 

the chuul are like reskinned from the normal ones
they have the same general shape, but are smaller, have large glowing orange eyes and white-blue fur. they are lawful good instead of lawful evil. they ride Otyugh, which are also reskinned. they are just mammoths. 

if the party does not go to the settlement, they are found by hunters. the hunters will initially be hostile but will become friendly when they speak as they realise they are not beasts. the hunters communicate with hand signals, so as to not alert any beasts or cause an avalanche

their village / settlement is inside a cavern in the mountain. there are giant shell-like fossils in the walls, which have been hollowed out and turned into buildings. they communicate telepathically, and are friendly unless they see the bomb. if they see the bomb, they will ask the party to leave. if the party does not leave, they will fight them. one of the hunters will be tasked to fight the party, which is one chuul and one otyugh. 

there is a sword with a sword taped on it in one of the houses.
there is a ring that grants the user short-range telepathy. 

the mountain is . a mountain . it can be climbed up, but they will have to speak quietly to avoid avalanches and they can be attacked by monsters.
they can misty step up, but the bomb reacts badly to nearby magic so it's risky. every time they misty step while holding the bomb, roll 1d20. if a 1, the bomb releases some of its charge and they take 1d4+1 damage. 

if anything hits the bomb, it leaks. it deals 2d4 damage to whatever it is touching 

there is an alternate path up the mountain through the cavern, but the chuul will be suspicious of why they need to reach the top. 

at the top, there is a completely flat section of ice. when they plant the device, the area begins to rise. it is a big as fuck bugturtle. it begins to roar and such. 

when they return, they are brought to see the scientist fridge guy. when they walk in, he is looking at a monitor showing 57.8%. when he notices them he tabs off it. the percentage is how close they are to being able to complete their final mission (ending the world)
he congratulates them on their success in making sure nothing was left behind. definitely absolutely nothing. he lied a LOT about the mission to the party and is acutely aware of it. doesnt feel guilty but is an awful liar

they are told they can choose to either continue working on "the low level baby fodder stuff" or that they can choose to advance to "the REAL missions". if they choose the first, keep the missions the same difficulty. if the second, level them up and raise difficulty.
