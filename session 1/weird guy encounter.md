weird guy is a weird guy wearing sunglasses a big hat and a trench coat. 

they come into the diner and get into an argument with the person at the bar who wont let them in cuz they look suspicious and refuse to show their face. 

read:
As the waiter gestures again for you to fork over the cash, there's a yell from the front of the diner. 
A coat-clad figure, face shrouded in the shadow of an obnoxiously wide hat-brim and eyes covered by sunglasses, is shouting something indecipherable at the woman working the till. She's blocking them from entering, it seems, and they're the argumentative type by the looks of it.
The figure in the doorway yells again and the waiter sighs dejectedly and runs over to help.
Amidst the fight, you see a scrap of paper fall out of the trench coat. None of them seem to notice as it's blown over toward you. 

hand them the paper

It's scrap of an old-world paper map; a rare sight these days. Someone's scribbled onto it in pen, and marked it with a strange insignia.
let them figure out what to do with it

if they ask about the diners layout:
There are two rows of booths on either side of the diner. There's a small island at the back where they serve drinks and take payment, with a door leading into the kitchen from behind it. There are a few tables up the front, with the front door being just behind the arguing party.

they can either [[leave through the back door]] or [[attempt to get past the people at the front ]]
