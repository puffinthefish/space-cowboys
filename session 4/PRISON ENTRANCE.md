The guards push you out of the room and into a docking hallway, where you're led one by one through an airlock and decontamination chamber. The door slides open, and you walk out into an enormously large room, walls made of that same red-accented white plastic-stuff, with an equally large window taking up most of a wall to your right. It's massive - a hundred metres across, at least - and through it you can see a blue light slowly rising as the Earth spins into view.
Despite its size, the place is strangely empty. There's no furniture of any kind, and no people. The only thing breaking up the monotony are the outlines of doors at equal intervals down the walls.
You can't look long, though; the guards shove you forward and lead you to a doorway at the other end. You pass through a few hallways, before entering the [[HOLDING CELLS]].

if a guard is attacked, all other guards *and* the managers are alerted. More will come to help. 

the room is 100 feet by 80 feet. it's flame resistant, same as the rest,
