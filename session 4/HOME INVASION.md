OPENING PASSAGE:
It's 1:34 AM on a Wednesday and there's someone banging on the apartment door. Nobody gets up to check it; none of you are awake enough for that. 
It stops for a few minutes, before returning much, *much* louder. There's the sound of splintering wood and creaking metal, and then a deafening crash as the door slams down onto the floor. 
Light floods the apartment, forcing you all awake. There are four piercing beams staring out at you from the front door. 
The owners of those torches are running straight at you. 

the police officers will try to immobilize or knock them out, but will never inflict lethal force. the players do not have their weapons on them.

they are inevitably chloroformed. phrase it as 
A cloth is shoved into your face, and before you can register what's happening, you're fading from consciousness. 

 ok fuck that imm just gonna write what happens and describe later
 RIGHT
 SO
 theyre woken up in the middle of the night by the door being bashed in. they get chloroformed and wake up on A [[SPACESHIP]]
small fight perhaps? throw them directly into a confrontation (that they will lose), good for character development

the four police officers are one relatively experienced one (will be better at fighting), one very new and two are experienced but a bit stupid

there are four police officers. they are wearing knight helmets![[helmet-medieval-knight-knight-s-helmet-red-feathers-helmet-medieval-knight-136064065.webp]] and carry halberds ![[Halberd 1.webp]]
the players CAN attempt to fight off the police officers but more will come after.
