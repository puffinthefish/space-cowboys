 The first thing you notice as you wake up is that this is *definitely* not the apartment. It doesn't look much like a holding cell either, or... any building you've ever seen, really.
 You're seated on benches placed around the walls of the room with your hands in cuffs. It's lit with a blindingly bright fluorescent light embedded in the ceiling, and it looks like the walls are made of some kind of smooth, sterile, shiny white plastic accented with red. There are no doors or windows, and you can feel a faint rumbling beneath your feet. The air smells like hand sanitizer and iron.
 There are three people you don't recognize sitting at the other end of the room, also in handcuffs. One you can recognize as an elf (who, by the way, has a giant robot arm), but the others are a bit stranger: one seems to be a rose bush in a vaguely humanoid shape, and one appears to be a giant bipedal mantis.
 The the bush looks as nervous as you are (at least, as far as you can tell), but the mantis seems oddly still, and the elf looks... bored? At the very least, she seems to be taking this a lot less seriously than everyone else.

the room is 10 feet by 20 feet, resistant to flame, and has raised platforms (the benches.)

there are three npcs in there with them.
these are:
[[RUBIG NOSA]]
[[VLEEGUS BLORPSMATTE]]
[[PLINK 'THE DESTROYER' 'FACEMASHER' 'NOSEBLASTER' PLONK]]

after they finish talking to the npcs:
A door opens in the wall and two guards enter. They're human in shape, both roughly six feet tall, but instead of heads they both have glowing, floating shapes that always seem to be looking at you. They're both wearing perfectly neat uniform, with a badge showing the insignia of the Frog Union pinned on the collars of their shirts. 

The guard with a glowing pink triangle for a head makes a grunt, and the rumbling stops. Everyone is jolted forward, save for the mantis (who somehow remains perfectly still and upright). THe guards lead you through the door, to [[PRISON ENTRANCE]]
