The lighting is dingier here. They clearly don't care about the state of this place as much as the rest of the station, as the walls seem to be coated in grime and mold. 
There are hundreds of cells in the complex, each a small concrete room containing a sink, a toilet and a bed. The wall facing the hallway is made of some transparent orange substance that crackles slightly. Each cell has two (or, if the prisoner is too large for that, just one) inmates, who seem to be all manner of mostly-unrecognizable creatures. 
The guards grunt again, before pulling out keycards and opening five cells. They chuck two of you in each, and the elf in the fifth one alone.

elf is alone
mantis goes with carl
gnome goes with reimika
lemon goes with morrigan
hydro goes with tazer

As you hit the concrete floor, you suddenly notice that the sound from outside seems to be muffled. The guard with the circle-head leaves, but the other stands outside in the hallway, keycard stuffed into their pocket.
