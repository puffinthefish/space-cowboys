read:
Flaming shards of ceramic are strewn about the cavern. The embers crackle violently on the rocky floor before sputtering out, though all sounds are drowned out by the ringing in your ears.
Looking around, you see that the narrow staircase you traveled down has collapsed. You're trapped down here.
Beyond the burnt outline of the gas tank you can see the explosion collapsed a thin wall of rock, revealing a small room containing two pedestals and behind them a large stone door. It's carved in strange patterns, but you can't quite make them out from here.
There are two tunnels dug into the rock, one to your left and one to your right. They don't seem to have been affected by the collapse.

says on door:
Inscribed on the door are ancient runes in some old-world tongue that, in all likelihood, has been completely forgotten. They're drawn under something more understandable, though: a large, triangular, red-bordered sign marked with a skull. Beneath the runes, there's a smaller orange sign marked with faded drawings that you can just make out to be two keys.

when they want to leave:
roll d6:
- In your peripheral vision you could swear you see a small, dark shape scuttling along behind you.
- You hear movement behind you, but there's nothing there when you turn around.
- There's a strange animalistic noise echoing through the cavern, but you can't tell where it comes from.
